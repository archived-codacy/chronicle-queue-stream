# Chronicle Queue Stream

This repo contains utilities to use a [Chronicle Queue](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue) to back your Akka Source/Sink and Flow.

## Credits

This repo elaborate a little further over the awesome work done in [squbs-pattern](https://github.com/paypal/squbs/tree/master/squbs-pattern).
Because of very business related motivations (i.e. publishing this library with checked compatibility for Akka 2.4 and 2.5) we felt the need to fork instead of contributing upstream.

## Usage

Most of the usage is extensively described [here](https://github.com/paypal/squbs/blob/master/docs/persistent-buffer.md), where instead of `PersistentBuffer` you will use `com.codacy.stream.ChronicleQueue`.

We have to add that for inter-process communication we provide additional `Source` and `Sink`.
